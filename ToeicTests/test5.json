Their business is board games, and they live and breathe everything to do with this hobby. \u2014 [1] \u2014 They met in their first year of college over a chessboard in the on-site student center. Morgan studied English literature while Olivieri was enrolled in the electrical engineering program. Nevertheless, they both bonded over their shared love of board games. Shortly after graduating, they decided to open a small board game store and coffee shop called Cup & Games in the trendy Pioneer Square neighborhood of downtown Seattle. \u2014 [2] \u2014 Initially, they wanted to provide board games, rent table space, and sell patrons coffee. \u2014 [3] \u2014 The idea quickly became popular, and within a year they were confident enough to open a larger space on 15th Avenue that catered purely to board games while allowing customers to bring their own refreshments. With the rise of Internet shopping, Morgan and Olivieri recently established a warehouse operation in the waterfront district to centralize their online board game sales. The business is now one of the country\u2019s largest independent game retailers. \u2014 [4] \u2014\u2014 Expecting their success to continue, analysts agree that these two are truly on a roll.",

We\u2019ve received several customer complaints about it recently.Britt Hepler\n4:24 P.M.\nCustomers claim that when they joined video conference calls the visual feedback from the web cam froze. Apparently, the audio continued to function, but nothing could be seen.Kate Erickson\n4:25 P.M.\nThis is obviously a huge problem because the system is usually purchased specifically for conference calls.Percy Ramsay\n4:27 P.M.\nOur in-house engineers believe the issue to be attributed to a wiring error. This affects the transmission of visual images from the camera to the computer.Britt Hepler\n4:28 P.M.\nGreat, so we\u2019ve discovered the problem! Then can I send replacement devices to customers who submitted complaints?Kate Erickson\n4:29 P.M\nNot yet. Let\u2019s put that aside. We should perfect the device first. Percy, you\u2019ve been working with the engineering team. Do you have a status update?Percy Ramsay \n4:32 P.M.\nThey\u2019re currently re-wiring the device. They will test the solution thoroughly, so I\u2019m not sure how long that will take.Kate Erickson\n4:33 P.M.Britt, as soon as new web cams have been manufactured, I'll let you know. Then you can mail replacements to the customers who've contacted you.Britt Hepler 4:35 P.M.Okay. Afterward, I will respond to customers and explain how we fixed the issue.",

Earlier this week I saw a flyer advertising new courses, and the money management session would be ideal for me. I need some professional training in how to create and maintain a budget. Could you tell me whether or not this class is full? I know I have missed the registration deadline by two days, but I hope that as long as there are still spaces open (and the class hasn't started yet), I might be able to still take it.

I reviewed the attached breakdown that you sent me, and I\u2019m afraid that I did notice a pretty significant mistake.\nYour e-mail says that I ordered fifty (50) boxes of a product, but I actually only ordered fifteen (15). I was rather shocked to see such a high number in the order, but I suppose the man on the phone simply misheard me. After all, the numbers do sound similar. Could you please make sure the amount due is updated before payment gets taken out of my account?\nSecondly, would it be possible for you to send me a new confirmation in which you itemize all the expenses including the ones that aren\u2019t currently listed? My company needs to see these charges broken down on separate lines. I hope this won\u2019t be too much work.\nThank you,\nJessie Patton\u00a0\u00a0",

I know that this was the first day that your parking garage has been closed, bu11 had a lot of difficulty getting my parking ticket validated. I first asked the cashier to do it as I was paying for a purchase, but she said she wasn\u2019t authorized to validate Kent Street parking tickets. She had to direct me to the mail\u2019s information desk. The process was too complicated and time-consuming.\nI think it would be better if cashiers could validate parking directly at the check-out. Please consider making this change.\nRegards,\nNatasha Lange\n___________________________\u00a0MEMOTo: Store ManagersFrom: Dave Voyles\nIn response to several customer complaints about parking validation, we are making a small change to our policy. Instead of directing customers to the mall information desk, all cashiers in individual stores will now be authorized to validate parking tickets for our temporary lot. This way, shoppers can get their parking validated at the same time they pay for their purchases. We believe that this process will be much easier for everyone involved. Please inform your staff members of this change and forward any questions to me.\nThank you,\nDave Voyles, Baxter Creek General Manager\u00a0\u00a0",
