Highland Park Preservation Society  September 30 Arnold Braxton145 Granville StreetVancouver, BC V5K 1B2Dear Mr. Braxton, Thank you for your generous donation to the Highland Park Preservation Society. The foundation you've contributed to aims to raise awareness amongst local residents of this region to ensure proper care and maintenance for the Highland Park. There are many different aspects to this campaign. We have engaged the City's Department of Parks and Recreation to give presentations to students in local schools about the park's history. We're organizing our annual Park Clean-Up Day on September 3rd for anyone in the region. Volunteers will assist in picking up litter, repairing benches and planting flowers and trees around historic buildings in an ongoing effort to restore and maintain the rich history and tradition of this special place. All community members are encouraged to attend, so if you are interested, please give us a call at 777-2388. A group of residents will also be creating a website where you can read about our ongoing efforts and upcoming events. Many people are working very hard on this initiative so we thank you again for you financial contribution. Kindest Regards, Leslie O'NealChairman of the Highland Park Preservation Society",

When talking on the phone it has a tendency to cut off in mid-conversation which is particularly frustrating. I am unsure as to the actual cause but I believe either the speaker on the phone is not working properly or the connection is poor. The microphone is working normally.This is the first time I have had problems using a mobile phone from my residence. I assume there is a fault with the equipment itself. I have also tried using the phone at my office which is quite far from my house, but I still couldn\u2019t figure out whether the problem is due to my phone or the phone of the person I was talking to.I would like to return my mobile phone. Please assist me on this matter.__________________________Dear customer,Thank you for your recent request. We\u2019ve checked our customer database, and it shows that you purchased your mobile phone, model XRS 456, on December 27th from our Eglinton store. We are deeply sorry that you are having problems with your new phone.In the event that the phone you purchased is defective then it may need to be returned to the manufacturer. However, we have currently been replacing our transmission towers near your location, and it may have been the reason for the problems you mention. Unfortunately, as a technical support specialist, I don\u2019t have the authority to help you with your particular request. Should you need any further assistance, please visit one of our BT&T stores.To find your nearest BT&T store please visit www.btandttelephones.com/storelocation.Regards,Peter StraghanTechnical Support Assistant",

However, I was disappointed by this experience with your store, especially in light of the claims made in the latest Zoomii brochure.\nI purchased a new magazine at your website on May 28 and it arrived 5 days later. Besides, this is not what I ordered! I called the customer service center to discuss the problem and I was told that the item I want is currently sold out and that I would have to wait for one week to get it. Furthermore, I was told that I would even have to charge a delivery fee. I expected that Zoomii would provide complimentary delivery service, to replace an item that was delivered in error.\nAs these problems, I would like to cancel my order and want a full refund. I hope your store will do a better work in the future to live up to its promise to keep your customers satisfied.\nSincerely,\nCarol Gracias",
