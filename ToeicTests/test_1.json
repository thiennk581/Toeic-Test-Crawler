While we were impressed with your enthusiastic personality, we decided to hire someone with a more intimate knowledge of the individual makes and models in order to reduce the need for in-house training. You also mentioned that you are working mornings at a high- end boutique and that you would need to give at least 30 days' notice to your current employer. As we discussed in the interview, we need a full-time worker available as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding.Sincerely,Nahum Balashov\nHR Director, Zapata Cars",

To:Undisclosed recipientsFrom:Dean Glover (d.glover@emperorind.net) Date:March 5Subject:Connection problemsGreetings everyone, This morning, we have received reports from various departments stating that the phone lines are down. We believe this has been caused by the lightning storm that occurred overnight. It seems that only the customer service, personnel, and marketing departments have been affected by this fault, with your phone lines in the sales department remaining unaffected. At this very moment, Terrence Preece from the IT department is working hard to restore full service to our phone network, and he is optimistic that this will be achieved by 6 P.M. today. In the meantime, we ask that even those who are able to use your phones, please communicate with the affected departments using e-mail only. We understand the impact that this disruption will have on your productivity rates, but we are hopeful that you will do your best to work within the limitations presented.Thank you for understanding.

To All Tenants, Please be advised that the water supply to the entire apartment complex will be shut off between the hours of 10 A.M. and 3 P.M. tomorrow. This is to enable the replacement of some old pipes, which have become corroded and fallen into a dangerous state of disrepair. The plumbing company has requested that all tenants take precautions prior to tomorrow's start time, as changes in water pressure can cause problems when the water supply is reactivated. To avoid any such problems from affecting you or your apartment, please ensure that: \u2022 All faucets are switched firmly to the 'off position. \u2022 Plugs are removed from all sinks and baths to prevent flooding in the event of high water pressure. \u2022 Toilets in your unit are not used throughout these hours. Toilets in the lobby will be available as normal.

I should be able to help you.Tracy Adkins \n8:45 P.M.\nThe shutter that covers the camera lens is stuck somehow. It only opens halfway when I turn the camera on. Obviously, I cannot take pictures.Faye Montero\n8:47 P.M.\nCan\u2019t you just return it to Viewsnap and have them give you a new camera?Tracy Adkins\n8:48P.M.\nI\u2019m afraid not. My warranty has expired, so they won\u2019t do anything about it.Chad Wilkes \n8:50 P.M.\nI have dealt with this problem before. The issue is a fault in the shutter\u2019s mechanism. Often, dust or particles become lodged among the components, which prevents the shutter from opening fully.Faye Montero\n8:52 P.M.\nI remember this happening to me once as well! The technician took the back cover off completely, sprayed compressed air over the circuit board, and replaced the back panel.Chad Wilkes \n8:55 P.M.\nMs. Montero is correct. Those steps should resolve the issue.SEND\u00a0",

I am the managing director of Excaliburize. We primarily operate an online store specializing in classic styles of clothing and household goods. On-site we have a medium-sized office, a large warehouse, and a small storefront. The office would need typical cleaning, and we would require only floor cleaning for the warehouse. However, we are looking for a business that can also provide extra services occasionally, including helping us with rearranging the retail apparel from time to time. Would this be possible? I look forward to hearing more about your business.Thank you, Sharon HargisManaging Director, Excaliburize",

City Sidewalk Gets an Upgrade   By Judith Motley  Yesterday, Clarkton city officials announced that they will be repaving some of the city\u2019s oldest and most uneven sidewalks this summer. Several pedestrians have complained about the cracked sidewalks for a while and the city finally has some funds to address the issue. The first street to be repaired will be Kincaid Avenue. Construction begins on August 20 and is expected to last for two weeks. After the completion of the first sidewalk, work will likely begin on Palin Drive, and later continue on Denton Parkway and Cardin Street as well. Updates will be released periodically as they become available.  ____________________________To:\tAbby Walker (abby@houstonelectronics.com)From:Edwin Houston (edwin@houstonelectronics.com)Date:\tJuly 25Subject:\tConstruction concernsHi Abby, Have you heard about the sidewalk repaving project that the city is going to do next month? I just read an article about it. I think it could create a problem for our business since it will be happening right in front of our store. \nBusinesses are encouraged to remain open, but I\u2019m worried that customers won\u2019t want to walk through a construction zone to come here. I\u2019ve already submitted a contact request to our city councilor and suggested another time that they can do the work. While I wait for his response, could you contact our marketing team and suggest making some large promotional signs that we can put out front? I want customers to know that we are still open during the construction and that they can still come inside. Thank you,Edwin___________________________www.nicholasdow.comPlease specify the nature of your message: \u25fb I have a question I have a problem\u53e3 I have a comment (no reply) My message to Nicholas DowI am the owner of Houston Electronics, which is in the middle of the first construction route. I am concerned that the proposed sidewalk repaving project is going to have a negative effect on my business. Is it possible to have the work done in the evening instead of during the day so that customers don\u2019t need to walk by construction to come to my store? Thank you, Edwin HoustonShould a response be sent to you? \uf0beYes\uf0a3 No E-mail: edwin@houstonelectronics.comThank you for contacting Mr. Dow!",
