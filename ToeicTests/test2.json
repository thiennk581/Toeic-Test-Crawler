Upcoming Restaurant Opening  By Ben Maxwell - Fairmount Daily Telegraph Contributor   FAIRMOUNT - Luigi's Kitchen will be open for business on Thursday, May 1st. Luigi's is another welcome addition to the many fine dining establishments located in Fairmount's waterfront district. Head Chef Luigi San Gregorio says, \"Luigi's specializes in fine Italian cuisine derived from his native upbringing in Rome. This delicious yet fairly common cuisine will be prepared to the highest possible standards using the finest ingredients. Customers can expect the freshest pasta, meats and seasonal vegetables. Our goal is to complete customer satisfaction and to ensure that they return over and over again.\"   San Gregorio, formerly head chef at Chez Mario's, began making a plan to open his own restaurant in Fairmount over two years ago. He evaluated several locations around the area but was set on the waterfront district. He ended up leasing space in the former garment warehouse building and helped pay for the renovations. San Gregorio added, \"I worked closely with special architects and city planners to ensure that most of the original structure was preserved and in line with current city zoning laws. We wanted to respect the rich history of this area.\"   Luigi's is spectacular inside and out. It remains to be seen whether the food is as appealing as the decor. Luigi's Kitchen will be open Tuesday through Sunday for lunch and dinner. The menu offers a wide selection of pricing options with the average price of a dinner being comparable to most restaurants in the waterfront district.",

It\u2019s a convenient location for me since I work at a nearby bank. The house has great curb appeal with its nice brick work. I also really like that it has a detached garage.\nHowever, I am slightly confused. I have seen two different prices listed for this house, one on your real estate company\u2019s website and the other on a flyer outside the property. The flyer lists the price as $5,000 more than the website does. Which one of these prices is accurate? Anyway, would you be able to set up a time for me to view the inside of the house?\nThanks.\nNathan Hays\n__________________________________________From:\u00a0cshirey@kwrealty.comTo:  nhay@networld.comRe:  2016 Wickham CourtDate: April 4\nDear Mr. Hays,\nI\u2019m glad that you are interested in this property. I apologize for the confusion regarding the listing price. The higher price on the flyer is incorrect as it does not reflect the recent price reduction. The correct price is the one listed on my company\u2019s website.\nI would be happy to set up a time for you to view the interior of the house. Just let me know which days and times you are available this week and I will speak to the owner and schedule an appointment.\nIn the meantime, if I can answer any other questions, please feel free to call me at 804-555\u00ac9520.\nI look forward to working with you.\nRegards,\nCharlotte Shirey",

I recently ordered the guides to London, Switzerland, Italy and Paris in preparation for a trip to Europe. I paid the charge for regular shipping and was pleasantly surprised when my order arrived in just four days. When I opened the box, I was even more delighted. The books were outstanding! I was impressed with the beautiful layout and breathtaking photographs even before I left for my vacation. When I arrived at my destination, I quickly discovered how wonderful they truly are.\nEvery detail was accurate and the guides covered not only famous, must-see sights, but also many little-known places that turned out to be very worth a visit. Had I not ordered books from Red Hill, I am sure I would have missed some worthwhile sightseeing opportunities.\nPlease count me as a new loyal customer. I have already recommended your books to friends who are planning trips abroad and will continue to do so.\nSincerely,\nSilvia\u00a0",
