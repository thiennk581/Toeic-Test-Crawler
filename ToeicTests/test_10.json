I noticed that the customers could view the webpage in a number of different languages and a feature which would be ideal for our customer base. I would like to employ this function and make it available for our Belgian customers. Would it be possible to send me the codes and tell me how to design this function? Then I can simply alter these language options for our targeted market to include Belgian, Norwegian, and Swedish consumers.I hope to see you when I attend the managerial workshops in Berlin next week. It is my first visit to Germany so I am looking forward to it. Perhaps we can meet up while I\u2019m there in case I have any additional questions regarding the program.Thank you for your time.Christopher Eggers",

You can be there in all the luxury of Explore Cruises' fabulous food, elegant state rooms, and on-board activities. We also offer daily lectures on the continent's wildlife and geology. A cruise ship is the best way to see Antarctica because most of the wildlife is found in dangerous spots. How would you like to see penguins, seals, and whales playing in water beneath gigantic icebergs? Or sight whales and albatross following the ship? The tourist season is only from November through February because the rest of the year is too cold, icy, and dark for travel. In December, you'll see hatching penguins and baby chicks.\nIn February, fledging chicks waddle on shore. The 10-day adventure begins at Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, where you'll board ship. On 4 of the 10 days, you'll take land excursions. If conditions are right, you'll be swimming in hot springs on one of these stops. This is the trip of a lifetime!\nFor more information, go to explorecruises.com",

As a result, we have no choice but to bill you for an estimated figure using previous months\u2019 usage.\nHowever, estimations can result in incorrect billing. It may be the case that we overestimate your usage and you will be charged more than you actually use. If we underestimate your usage, you could receive a larger bill after we read the actual amount.\nWe suggest that you take a reading of your own meter and submit it in order to prevent another estimated billing. Details of how to read your meter are enclosed with this letter and are very explanatory. Once you obtain an actual reading, it can be submitted to our automated telephone system by calling at 555-4376-5498 on your scheduled reading date.\nAlternatively, if you wish to have your meter read by a BE employee, you can schedule a specific time which is convenient for you by calling 555-4376-3244 before August 8th.\nTony Starks\nCustomer Relations Manager\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BE Corporation\nMonthly Statement - July\nAccount No: 5789-23-4376\nService to: Edward Diamond\n345 Palace View, Apt. 6A\nWinterbottom, TX C67 LM7Account Summary\nBalance from last bill: $45.67\nPayment received July 5 - Thank you!: $45.67\nCurrent monthly charges: $20.05\nAmount Due on August 12th : $20.05Billing Details\nTotal Kilowatt-hours(kwh)used in 30 days 215*\n* : estimated\nBasic service charge: $6.05\nSupply\nEnergy 215kwh@0.100000: $21.50\nTotal Electric Charges: $27.55\nNext Meter Reading Date: August 19",

A televised press conference is scheduled for this afternoon at 4:00 p.m., after which it will be in all the news media. As CEO, I\u2019ll be in charge of this matter. Also, we must do everything to protect Food World shoppers and make them feel confident shopping for produce in our stores. I would like you to write an urgent text message as well as e-mail. You cannot overstate the importance of doing this! Please send me a copy of your text message before disseminating it to our stores. Thank you.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom: Vanessa Williams  <vwilliams@foodworld.com>\nTo: Hank Morris  <hmorris@foodworld.com>\nDate: October 8\nRe: E.coli outbreak\nHank,\nI\u2019ve attached, for your review, my e-mail. As a senior manager, I also suggest that Food World executives meet today to discuss how to deal with customers\u2019 fears about purchasing fresh produce. A bacteriologist, specializing in large-scale farming, has agreed to be available for the meeting, at any time this afternoon. At the meeting, I would like to propose developing a brochure directed to customers. It should address what E.coli is, how it affects people, how fields are tested for bacteria, the reliability of these tests, and consumer safe handling of fresh fruits and vegetables.The brochure should be available as soon as possible after press coverage of the outbreak.\nThis brochure should help our customers understand that their safety is our priority and that they can feel comfortable buying Food World produce.\u2003\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFrom : Vanessa Williams\nReceived : October 8, 2:28 P.M.\nTo : All store managers\nAny fresh leafy vegetable and fruits processed after Sept. 30 should be immediately removed from shelves. No vegetables processed after Sept. 30 should be restocked until further notice. Managers, yourselves, should do the actual product removal. After removal is completed, store managers should e-mail a confirmation to me. Thank you.",
