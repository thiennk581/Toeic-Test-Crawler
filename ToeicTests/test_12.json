Instead, three cases of staples were sent by mistake. 2.The charge for 500 sheets of computer paper (#CU 289292) appeared on the invoice; however, only 100 were delivered. 3.Credit of $49.77 from last month\u2019s shipment was not credited to this month\u2019s order. Please make sure next month\u2019s bill is credited with this amount.I will keep the cases of staples since we usually order them anyway. However, we have already paid for the paper clips which are $43.19 over the price of the staples. Therefore, please credit our next shipment with this amount. Please correct the above mistakes as soon as possible. Thank you for your prompt attention. Sincerely, Hasan Saas",

We are now beginning to see the Internet used to also create music in a whole new way. You can plug your guitar into your computer and play, in real time, with someone from another city or country. There are about half a dozen sites where musicians can meet, compose, and play together.\nStudio sessions are also possible on the Internet. \u2014[2]\u2014. Each person lays down an individual track to be part of a finished product. For example, a male guitarist and singer recently went on a site with his composition. The music was heard by a female vocalist who laid down a harmonizing track to be played with his. This was followed by a violinist who liked what he heard and who wanted to be part of it. A pianist also offered a track that the group decided to use. \u2014[3]\u2014. This band of four plans to continue to work together. Their sound has earned global attention, also through the Internet. Their music has even been played on traditional media such as radio. Members of this group were developed out of several hundred site visitors who offered tracks to the original guitarist and singer.\nMusicians, who collaborate on these sites, literally have a world of opportunities to meet other musicians. \u2014[4]\u2014. Gone are the days when musicians find each other only by knowing some of the same people. Now musicians can easily meet thousands, if not millions, of other musicians.\nThis could even become the next generation of record labels.\u00a0",

You\u2019re welcome. Tim Hastings  [3:34 P.M.]Cumberland Hotel\u2019s renovation project certainly comes at an inconvenient time for us! Clara Muller [3:35 P.M.]Right! So I \u2019ve checked into other options to accommodate the participants of the upcoming conference. Clara Muller [3:35 P.M.]Unfortunately, it is now quite late to find the best group rates since the conference is in less than two months. Tim Hastings [3:36 P.M.]I think it will be best to book the most convenient hotel, so I am inclined to go with the option closest to the conference. Clara Muller [3:37 P.M.] The Anderson Inn is right across the street from the conference center location and can offer us a reasonable group rate as we expected ($120 per night). Clara Muller [3:38 P.M.]However, they can only guarantee us 30 rooms at that price; any participants over that number will have to pay the normal seasonal rate of $180. Tim Hastings [3:40 P.M.]That\u2019s expensive. We currently have about 40 registrations, so the majority of attendees will pay the same rate as they would have at the Cumberland. Clara Muller [3:41 P.M.]The Bayview Lodge is only a little further away and can provide us with 50 rooms, but the price is much higher than either the Cumberland or the Anderson. Tim Hastings [3:43 P.M.]Okay. What else?  Clara Muller [3:45 P.M.]The cheapest rate I could find was at the Whiteflower Hotel, but, as that is outside the central business district, we would have to cover the expense of providing shuttle service to the conference site. Tim Hastings [3:46 P.M.]Please do not release this information until further notice. I think we need to be careful to inform everyone at the same time, so that the participants have the same chance to obtain rooms at the group rate. Tim Hastings [3:48 P.M.]Thanks again, Ms. Muller! and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing you at the conference.",

I am seeking an internship in market research. I believe that my business degree and my interpersonal skills qualify me for a position in this area.\nAs my enclosed resume indicates, I had served as a part time assistant at Mauer Advertising for one year. My other experiences include conducting opinion polls for my university newspaper and attending an advertising class at the university. I am extremely interested in working at Advertising Research Group and would welcome to speak with you further about the internships you have available.\nSincerely yours,\nRita Warren\n_______________________________\nRita warren\n3 Carver Street\nBrooklyn, NY 11201\nApril 6\nDear Ms. Warren,\nThank you for your letter and resume. We are always interested in providing opportunities to recent graduates with experience and qualifications.\nUnfortunately, at the present time, we have no open internships that match your specific interest. On a more positive note, however, we are looking for a trainee to help conduct market research opinion polls. It is a one-year internship that could lead to the offer of permanent employment. If this type of work interests you, I suggest you contact Juan Santos, the head of our human resources department, to discuss the responsibilities of the internship.\nYours truly,\nKaren Paxton\nPaxton Advertising Research Group",

I have always paid my rent on time, and have never had any issues arise with respect to the level of service offered. However, last month, my bathroom sink began leaking, and I immediately called the building manager, who told me she would contact a maintenance person.\nYet, no one has been to fix or check up on the damage. Since then I have called a plumber to look at the damage and he has given me an estimate on the repairs. I have enclosed an estimate from the plumber.\nMoreover, it took 2 days for a plumber to arrive, by which time a significant amount of water had leaked onto the dining room carpet. While I did my best to dry up the water, it has left a permanent stain. I informed the building manager of the stain, and she sent a cleaner to steam clean the carpet. The stain was removed, but I arrived home today to find a bill for $75 for the cleaning services.\nI have paid the bill, but would like to ask that I be refunded the full amount (or have it deducted from next month\u2019s rent of $650.00 ).\nThank you,\nOlivia Kimberly\nApartment 809\n______________________________Pipes & Plumbing \n175 Canson Street, San Francisco, CA 10123 Pipes & PlumbingDate : December 20\nReplacement & Repair EstimateCustomer Name :  Olivia KimberlyEstimated Cost of Labor: $ 60.00Estimated Cost of Materials : $ 199.00Additional Cost: $ 59.00Total Estimated Cost: $ 318.00\n_______________________To: Olivia Kim (olivia_kim@synergies.com)From:  Walter Arnold (w_arnold@taylorbayapt.com)Date: January 11Subject: Maintenance issues\nDear Ms. Kimberly,\nI am sorry to hear about the difficulties you have encountered this month with your apartment.
