According to your complaint, the interior plate spins while in use but the food actually does not heat up. Unfortunately, there have been a number of complaints about this particular device as well as others made by the same manufacturer. As we take customer satisfaction very seriously, we no longer carry products made by Owada Electronics.\nWe would like to send you a substitute device that is of comparable size and slightly higher value - Turbo Chrome Microwave from Franco, Inc. The item will be shipped to you free of charge. We hope that you find this arrangement suitable and that you continue to shop at Hometime Outlet for all your household needs.\nWarmest regards,\nErica Dolan\nCustomer Service Agent\nHometime Outlet",

In the past, we have visited children\u2019s hospitals, participated in cleanup projects at local parks, and helped raise money for the local volunteer fire service. Continuing this tradition, this year our community outreach program will be sponsoring a local nonprofit support group for homeless  people. Helms Shelter has looked after our community for nearly 80 years, and we are proud to be able to help them in their important work. Employees can assist by donating items of clothing, canned food, blankets, and sheets. Please bring the items to Sally Fredericks in the second floor administration department. She will be coordinating delivery with the shelter. If you would like to make a financial contribution, please leave the cash with Georgina Hastings in finance. Ms. Hastings will record and process all funds and ensure they arrive safely with the trustees at Helms. Please give generously and make a difference to the less fortunate among us.Yours sincerely, Herbert ChapmanChairperson, IdeaTech",

            "paragraph": "refer to the following article. Manningtree to Restore Chromeburry Hall  By Richard Evert While many marvel at the modern and the new, residents of Manningtree find beauty in all things classical. This explains why this small town in England is now engaging in a massive effort to restore the glory of its vintage structures. A team of local architects, called the Green Construction Society (GCS), is in partnership with the local government to reconstruct historical buildings in the area. After successfully restoring the Arc Cathedral and other buildings last year, the society is now preparing to refurbish Chromeburry Hall. \u201cLast year\u2019s project inspired us to work on the music hall,\u201d GCS President Samuel Morse said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to start working again.\u201d Chromeburry Hall, a 300-year-old concert hall located on Courtney Street, used to be a popular venue for operas and orchestra shows until the 1930s. During that time, the walls and ceilings of the building had started to deteriorate, making it unsafe for use. Since it was more expensive to restore the music hall than build a new venue, the government decided to close the building and construct the Atlas Theater. The GCS and the government hope to turn the abandoned structure into a music museum. However, Morse said much work has yet to be done, and the society is in need of more volunteers. \u201cAny form of help would go a long way,\u201d Morse said. \u201cWe hope our fellow citizens will join us in this endeavor.\u201d Residents interested in volunteer work may log on to the society\u2019s Web site, www.gcsociety.com, to learn more about the project.",

The event runs from June 11 to June 15, and your main presentation is scheduled for June 14 in the main auditorium. The organizers would like to extend an invitation for you to stay free of charge at the Gordon Convention Center's hotel facility at 3708 Farland Street.

Software manufacturer Compitec responds to consumer feedback By Dwayne CherryApril 5\u2014At a press conference held yesterday afternoon, Compitec\u2019s research and development director, Steve Reynolds, announeed that the company is to make sweeping changes to its word-processing software in light of negative customer feedback. Compitec released its latest version of the software, TypePro version 8.0, in January this year, hoping to gain a larger market share before rival company Digicom releases its product this July. \u2014 [1] \u2014According to reports, one of the fundamental concerns raised by users of the software was the lack of formatting options provided. Users reported that they were also frustrated by the limited number of font choices available, as well as their inability to change the size of the text. Many customers also reported not being able to insert pictures or other graphics into documents. \u2014 [2] \u2014 Finally, over 500 users took to Compitec\u2019s Web site to express their disgust with printing problems. For example, printouts often appear in a completoy different format from what was displayed on-screen. Reynolds said that developers are working \u201caround the clock\u201d to improve the 8.0 software. The company hopes version 8.01 will address all the issues that plagued version 8.0. \u2014 [3] \u2014 To do so, Director of Commercial Operations, Susan Torpey, also announced that all existing customers who have already purchased version 8.0 would receive a free copy of the updated product as a \u201ctoken of goodwill.\u201d \u2014 [4] \u2014 However, it remains to be seen whether this gesture can repair the damage done to the company\u2019s reputation in the eyes of the public.",

I am interested in seeing the property. It\u2019s located exactly halfway between my office and my husband\u2019s and I prefer to live in units that are high in the building.\nIt\u2019s almost perfect, although the $1,300 price is a little above my preferred budget. This isn\u2019t the only concern that I would like to discuss with you. For instance, we would need a second parking space, and I wonder if I\u2019ll be allowed to do that. My husband and I would like to look at the apartment and discuss a few matters. Would tonight be convenient for you? We are available anytime after 7 P.M.\nThank you in advance,\nAnna Groves\n_____________________________________\nMs. Anna Groves\nApt. 809\n3057 Davis Court\nOlney, IL 62450\nDear Ms. Groves:\nI hope today\u2019s moving day has gone smoothly and this letter finds you well. I am so pleased to have you and your husband as the new tenants in unit 809. Enclosed with this letter is a copy of your rental agreement, a receipt for your $1,200 first month\u2019s rent in January, and the weekly garbage pick-up schedule.\nI also wanted to let you know that your parking spaces have been assigned and they are #14 and #15 on the second level of the parking garage. You can pick up your parking passes from someone in the building\u2019s office later today.\nPlease contact me if you have any questions or concerns as you get settled.\nSincerely,\nWes Norcross\nDumphries Apartment",
