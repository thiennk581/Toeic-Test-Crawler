In order to address declining sales, we started making vitamins designed specifically for children.Bridgette Bartels \n11:11 A.M.\nWe began selling these vitamins a year ago, and we allocated a substantial budget to advertising efforts in order to promote them.Jon Childers\n11:13. A.M.\nThanks for the detailed explanation. I remember seeing the commercials on TV. I\u2019ve also driven by the billboards on the side of the road. That must have helped a lot with sales.Bridgette Bartels\n11:15 A.M.\nThat\u2019s true. I\u2019ve analyzed the sales data. The results are about 15% higher than we had projected.Oliver Ventura\n11:17 A.M.\nBecause the sales are so high, I think we can stop paying so much to advertise it. We don\u2019t need to continue running such a big campaign anymore.Bridgette Bartels \n11:19 A.M.\nI agree. We can do without it. Clearly the product has responded to a need in the market. I think customers will continue to buy these vitamins even if we do less marketing.Jon Childers \n11:20 A.M.\nThat sounds reasonable. And it\u2019s also time to start an advertising plan for our next product.Oliver Ventura \n11: 21 A.M\nDo you mean our newest line of vitamins intended for adults seeking to lose weight?Jon Childers\n11: 22 A.M\nYes. We will start selling them in about three months.SEND",

Centerbrook Art Gallery is pleased to announce that renowned painter Henry Turner will be joining us on the evening of May 17 as part of his promotional tour for his forthcoming book, A Life in Painting, which will be released on May 31. Henry Turner was born in Somerset, England, and grew up in the beautiful countryside that would later become the inspiration behind some of his paintings. \u2014 [1] \u2014 Mr. Turner began attending the Royal Art College in London in 1975, and it was here that he held his first exhibition one year later, displaying his range of work focusing on animals and nature. Around this time, he met his wife, Selma, a fellow painter and student at the college. They married in 1977. The coupie moved to Fort Pearcy in the United States later that year. \u2014 [2] \u2014 Once settled in their new country, they roamed the great American outdoors, exploring the breathtaking scenery that would eventually feature heavily in Turner\u2019s work. During the May 17 event at Centerbrook Art Gallery, Mr. Turner will discuss some of the art techniques mentioned in his new book. \u2014 [3] \u2014 Members of the audience will also have the opportunity to ask questions of Mr. Turner when the talk has ended. Call 555-3229 to reserve tickets. There is limited seating available, so we will not be offering tickets at the door. \u2014 [4] \u2014 Those wishing to see more of Mr. Turner\u2019s work are advised to visit his Web site at www.henryturner.com.",

Koko Coffee Forms Partnership with WB Foods After months of negotiations, coffee chain Koko Coffee-in Munich, Germany-the terms of its partnership with supermarket giant WB Foods. Koko Coffee opted for the move in order to reach the growing number of middle-class Asian consumers. Koko Coffee has made several attempts over the past few years to expand market penetration in Asia on its own, but failed to prosper in the already crowded market. \u2014 [1] \u2014 When CEO Dylan Preston took over last year, he steered the company's strategy for Asia in a new direction.\u2014 [2] \u2014 As a result, executives hope the partnership will allow Koko Coffee to build trust and gain brand recognition. Koko Coffee representatives traveled to Taipei to sign the agreement at the WB Foods headquarters. Sales of Koko Coffee's drinks across Germany have been in steady decline due to weak marketing campaigns and missed opportunities on social media sites. \u2014 [3] \u2014 But with a new approach in Asia, Koko Coffee could start gaining momentum again. A company spokesperson reported that Koko Coffee will operate on-site coffee shops at select WB Foods locations, starting with twenty-five initially and expanding over the next five years to all branches. \u2014 [4] \u2014 Other large European chains are watching carefully to determine whether Koko Coffee's strategy will become a success story or a cautionary tale.",

From:Percy Whittaker (pwhittaker@forummagazine.com)To:Beth Seymour (bethseymour@regencyreviews.net)Date:March 30Subject:Proposal for More WorkDear Ms. Seymour,I received your review of The Handbook for Successful Suburban Gardening and was so impressed with your critical evaluation of the book that I have requested a personal interview with the author for one of our future follow-up pieces. Although we print reviews of all kinds of books, we try to predict which books will generate the most interest among our readers. Forum magazine's audience seems to be dominated by those who like to read about well-being and nutrition. Our May publication will feature an article on the historic grounds and greenhouses of Rideaux Hall. Coincidentally, the head gardener, Todd Laurence, has written a book entitled Cultivating Sorrow and Success that I would like to highlight alongside the article. Transitioning from garden to kitchen, for our cooking enthusiasts, we would also like to feature a review on Jane Northwick's Fields of Bounty, a practical guide to growing homegrown vegetables and herbs for cooking. You are obviously a keen reader of books within this literary genre, and we were hoping that you have the capacity to review both books by April 19 for our May edition. Please reply immediately to confirm whether you would be available. If you are busy and think you would only manage to write one, please state your preference as to which one you would be able to evaluate by the above deadline.Regards,Percy WhittakerEditor-In-ChiefForum Magazine_______________________________From:Beth Seymour (cbethseymour@regencyreviews.net)To:Percy Whittaker (pwhittaker@forummagazine.com)Date:April 1Subject:RE: Proposal for More WorkDear Mr. WhittakerHaving already critiqued a book on the trials of suburban gardening, I would enjoy reviewing Cultivating Sorrow & Success, as I am sure it offers an interesting rural perspective on gardening. However, regarding the second book yew listed, I have some reservations. I have reviewed two of the author's previous books, and I am simply not a fan of her writing style. Therefore, I might not be well placed to evaluate her latest release.\u2003 I would prefer to review two books, however, so I\u2019d like propose a different book for my second submission. Might you consider From Garden to Table by Jeanette Winthrop? Jeanette is a passionate gardener who advocates using your own backyard as a local source of produce. Finally, with regard to the April 19 submission deadline, would it be possible to extend this by a couple of days? Hopefully this won't be necessary, but the deadline for two pieces is a little tight. I know that the magazine will hit shelves on the last day of the month, as always, so I am hoping you can extend my deadline to April 23 if I'm a bit behind schedule.Regards, Beth SeymourRegency Reviews",

According to the information you submitted, you are interested in knowing the cost to cater an event of 75 guests, but it depends on what meal you select. I\u2019ve attached our brochure for you.\nI want to inform you about two things regarding this brochure:\n1)We no longer provide the vegetable lasagna as an option. The brochure hasn\u2019t been updated to reflect that change yet.\n2)The prices listed at the bottom of each package include the delivery and setup of the food at your venue. In addition, you will receive complimentary coffee, tea, and soft drinks for your guests. However, we do not provide people to serve the food. If you would like us to fill this roe at your event, we will charge a separate rate for that service.\nPlease let me know which package you prefer.\nRowan Charles\nContemporary Catering\n____________________________\u00a0Package APackage BPackage CPackage DSalad (choice of one)Garden salad\n\t\t\tCobb saladGarden salad\n\t\t\tCaesar saladCaesar salad\n\t\t\tGreek saladCrab salad\n\t\t\tCaesar saladEntree (choice of one)Vegetable lasagna *\n\t\t\tTropical swordfish\n\t\t\tChicken teriyakiMushroom caps * Poached salmon Smoked porkEggplant parmesan * Grilled Ahi tuna Braised lambBrown-rice risotto * Pan-seared scallops Roasted chuckDessert (choice of one)Chocolate cake Pecan tartsChocolate cake Apple pieChocolate cake Cherry cheesecakeChocolate cake Creme bruleePrice per person$23.99$25.99$29.99$35.99\u00a0\u2022 Vegetarian entrees are marked with a *.\u00a0",
