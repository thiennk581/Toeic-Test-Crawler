I always hire additional staff for this period, and this year I believe I\u2019ll need to recruit thirty more employees to keep up with the increased demand. Before I place the recruitment advertisements in the local newspapers, I would like to offer the chance for any of our part-time workers to take on longer hours. While this will not confer full-time worker benefits, it is a great opportunity to earn some extra money. Anyone interested should notify me by next Friday, after which time the work schedule will be drawn up and advertisements will be posted.\nThanks,\nDaphne Morris\u00a0",

Reviewing your documents, I can see that your writing experience with a fashion magazine and the local newspaper is precisely what some of our clients are looking for. Your master\u2019s degree in journalism is also something that employers find attractive. \u2014 [2] \u2014.\nYou mentioned that you are looking for a permanent staff writer position at a national newspaper or magazine, and I think I have found a match for you. The Independent Herald is a respected newspaper with a daily international circulation of over 500,000 readers and, they are looking for a staff writer for the fashion section of their weekend supplement.\nI am more than happy to put your name forward for this position, but there is one possible problem. They are based around 90 miles from your current address, which means either a long commute or relocating closer to their offices in downtown Portland, Oregon. \u2014 [3] \u2014.\nPlease let me know if this is acceptable to you as soon as possible, as the deadline for applications is February 28. \u2014 [4] \u2014. If not, I am sure we can find something a little closer to you, although this opportunity is the one that most closely matches your stated career goals.\nBest regards,\nElizabeth Reeve\nStaffing Specialist, Reeve & Associates",

I have attached a copy of his lease agreement and personal details. He will go to the Silver Lake main office on July 26 to pay $2,100 up front for the first month of rent for the apartment. His lease officially begins on August 1, and he will arrive with his belongings at around 8 A.M. on that day. Therefore, I have notified the building manager and asked him to have the apartment ready by July 31. Mr. Fassbender chose the dark chocolate rug for the apartment.\nI have another client interested in renting your last remaining studio apartment, and a family of four has asked to view the three-bedroom apartment. Once I close those deals, all of the ten apartments you own in the building will be leased. It has been a pleasure representing you and your property interests.\nRegards,\nAmy Heaton",

I was glad to see that the attendance figures showed a 15% increase from last year. I wanted to give you all my thoughts on the conference generally along with some updates.\nFirstly, I particularly enjoyed the printed materials handed out to attendees at the X-ray talk. They were useful during the presentation, and I also expect to refer to them in my day-to-day practice.\nSecondly, Dr. Foster and Dr. Helms both wanted to express their regret that time constraints made it impossible for them to include the scheduled question-and-answer sessions at the end of their respective lectures. They have, however, agreed to run an online version through the forums on our Web site, www.hmaconference.com, over the next two weeks. So head over there and add your voice to the discussions.\nLastly, in the near future, we will be making a decision on the location of next year\u2019s conference. Details to follow by the end of the month.\nBest regards,\nHillary Conkey\nPresident, Holistic Medicine Association",

First, the services were provided two days later than was originally agreed upon. I hope that next week, the work will be performed on time.\nMore importantly, I was charged for a service that I did not ask for. Your cleaning team did a wonderful job of cleaning our office, including the staff break room, but I had specifically requested that this area be left alone. We're about to have it remodeled and thus there was no need for it to be cleaned. I would like to have a new invoice created with this charge removed.\nOther than these concerns, I was very impressed with the work performed by your staff.\nKind regards,\nSteve Cannon\nHenson Employment Center\u00a0\u00a0",

            "paragraph": "Saying Goodbye to IronsideBy Emmie Yates\nThe band Ironside broke the hearts of its fans earlier this year when it announced that the band intends to separate. The trio, which was founded in 2002, has enjoyed a highly successful career that includes three best-selling albums and three world tours. However, guitarist and lead singer Tom Baxley declared that he wanted to leave the band in order to begin a solo career. The other members decided not to continue without him.\nHowever, before the band disassembles officially, it will hold four concerts at the Wilmington Amphitheater over the next two months. The performance dates are January 1, January 15, February 2, and February 24.\nTicket prices vary from $95 to $229 based on distance from the stage. The furthest seats are cheapest. Some critics have remarked that these ticket prices are too high for a farewell performance, but the cost doesn\u2019t appear to bother fans. According to the band\u2019s manager, James Tucker, \u201cTickets are selling quickly! If you don\u2019t buy soon, you might not get one!\u201d Tickets can be bought online at www.ironsideconcert.com/tickets.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------E-MAIL MESSAGE To: Ray Upton (ray@connection.ca)From: Arlene Payne (payne@mail.com)Date: December 9Subject: Ironside PerformanceAttached: News article\nRay, have you heard the news? Ironside is holding a goodbye tour! I've included an article about it. Ever since we saw them perform the first year they came out, you and I have talked about going to another one of their concerts together. Now we're running out of time to do it! I'd really like to see this concert with you, so we need to plan quickly. Tickets are selling really fast.\nI called the concert hall and there's already one show, the one on the 2nd, that's entirely sold out. Likewise, the concert on January 15 only has the cheapest tickets left because all the rest have been sold. Furthermore, I know that you're on vacation over Christmas and New Year's, so that concert date also doesn't work. Hopefully we can work something out, though.\nLet me know which date and seating area you prefer as soon as possible. I want us to get tickets before it's too late!\nArlene\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0Ironside Concert Ticket Purchase Confirmation \n**This is not your ticket.**\nThis is confirmation of your purchase only.\nYour concert ticket(s) will be mailed to you within 7 days.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TICKET INFORMATIONCUSTOMER INFORMATIONDate of show: February 24Purchased by: Ray UptonNumber of tickets: 1Credit card number: 5138 3610 3759 1047Purchase total: $229Purchase date: December 11Seat number(s): 17BMailing address: 1882 Meadowbrook Rd., Wilmington, CA 90744\u00a0\u00a0",
