The existing transit infrastructure was deemed unable to support the projected future growth in the region. As a result, regional councils committed to partnered integration of all modes of transportation in order to deliver the required mobility solution. \u2014 [1] \u2014The new express line will provide a high-quality rail service connecting Dunbar Subway Station in the downtown area directly to Terminal A at Peterson International Airport. This will address the current lack of airport transportation options and improve the quality of life for residents by lessening downtown congestion and fueling economic prosperity. Projections indicate that within the first year of operation, the Dunbar-Peterson Express will eliminate at least 500,000 vehicle journeys to and from the airport. \u2014 [2] \u2014\u2014As a further step toward greater coordination and integration of transportation in the region, Metro-Linx has contracted the software development company PlexTex Technologies to develop the GOCARD ticketless transportation system.\u2014\u2014 [3] \u2014 This card, and the accompanying turnstile technology, will allow commuters to travel between multiple transit systems (subway, bus, and train) within the region using a single card. \u2014 [4] \u2014 The GOCARD will only be operational within the Metro-Linx regional network of Thompson, Carrville, Bailey City, and Harden Township.",

I was very sorry to hear that you were unaware of the data roaming charges you were accumulating during your recent trip to Taiwan. As you mentioned in your e-mail, many older customers are not familiar with the complicated menus on some of the newer phone models, and we here at Astro Telecom do understand this issue.\nIt is normally the policy of our company to show no leniency for accidental data roaming charges, but in certain cases we can make an exception. Based on your data history, it is clear that this was a genuine accident, so we will waive the fee this time only. However, I advise you to become more familiar with your cell phone settings in order to avoid any similar mishaps in the future. Finally, I see that you did actually pay the full balance before bringing this issue to our attention. Accordingly, the roaming charges will be credited back to your mobile account on August 15. This will be deducted from your next bill on September 5.\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.\nSincerely,\nAnnabeth Williams\nCustomer Service Manager\nAstro Telecom\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

However, I have yet to receive a confirmation e-mail. I called my credit card company and verified that the amount has been paid in full, so I'd like to check that you have my reservation on file.\nAdditionally, I paid the full amount for tours for two people, but my travel partner can no longer make it. So, I would like to have the second payment back. I have included a screenshot of the Web site confirmation page that I got at the time of booking.\nPlease reply using this e-mail address or the number 555-933-7458 to let me know when the refund has been successfully processed.\nThank you very much,\nAngela Moseley\u00a0",
